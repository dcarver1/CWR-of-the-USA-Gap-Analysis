## Summary for `r species`

The table below shows a summary of the occurrence records for the taxon. A record "with coordinates" is one that has a complete set of latitude and longitude values associated with it, which could be used for distribution modeling, the preliminary threat assessment, and the conservation gap analysis. For this analysis, such records with coordinates were confined to those falling within the target native area, i.e. native states/administrative areas within the United States (including its territories), Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands, as listed per taxon in USDA ARS GRIN Global Taxonomy (2020). In preparation for the conservation gap analyses, we classified each record based on whether it was an existing ex situ sample from a genebank or botanic garden (labeled G, as most records were from genebanks), or a reference observation (labeled H, as most of these records were from herbaria).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

    c1a <- as.data.frame(read.csv(paste0(baseDir,'/counts.csv')))
    }else{
      print("There are no occurrences present for this taxon")
      }

### Predictors used in modeling process 
The table below shows the ecogeographic variables listed in order of importance based on the occurrence dataset, including whether or not they were used for distribution modeling, following the variable selection process.  
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(length(include(csv,"predictorImportance.csv")) == 0){
  print("Models were not produced for this taxon due to insufficent occurrences")
}else{
  t2 <- read.csv(include(csv,"predictorImportance.csv"))
  t2 <- dplyr::left_join(x = t2, y= layerDescription, by = c("varNames" = "layer"))
  t2 <- t2 %>% dplyr::select("varNames","description" ,"importance","includeInFinal","source")
    colnames(t2) <- c("Variable name", "Description", "Relative importance to model", "Included in the modeling process", "Data source")
  t2 <- round_df(x = t2, digits = digits)
  DT::datatable(t2)
}
```

<br>

### Evaluation metrics
For each taxon with at least 25 distinct coordinates in the target spatial area, the modeled distribution was calculated as the median of ten MaxEnt model replicates (K = 10), using linear, quadratic, product, and hinge features, with a regularization parameter ÃŸ=1.0. For taxa with 8-24 distinct coordinates, the median of six replicates (K = 6) was calculated, and for taxa with 3-7 distinct coordinates, the median of three replicates (K = 3) was calculated. Model runs for taxa where MaxEnt failed within these established groupings were rerun in fewer replicate categories. Taxa with fewer than 3 distinct coordinates were not modeled. The table below shows the statistical results for each replicate.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(length(include(csv,"eval_metrics_rep.csv")) == 0){
  print("Models were not produced for this taxon due to insufficent occurrences")

### Statistics for median of the model runs
The median result across the replicates is shown below. To be considered an accurate and stable model (see the field "Valid"), we are looking for an AUC >= 0.7; SDAUC < 0.15; and ASD15 <= 10.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(length(include(csv,"eval_metrics.csv")) == 0){
  print("Models were not produced for this taxon due to insufficent occurrences")
}else{

### Maps of model outputs
<br>

#### Median

The map below shows the median spatial result from the species distribution model runs. Values in the key refer to the probability of occurrence. The occurrences used in the modeling process are represented by dots, distinguishing between G and H records (as available), and the attribute data associated with the points can be viewed by clicking on the dots. The background shows the target native area (i.e. the occupied native country-ecoregion area).
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(length(include(csv,"eval_metrics_rep.csv")) == 0){
  print("Models were not produced for this taxon due to insufficent occurrences")
}else{
  # split the g and h values into different points 
      gP <- cleanPoints[cleanPoints$type == "G",]
    hP <- cleanPoints[cleanPoints$type == "H",]
  if(length(unique(cleanPoints$type)) >1){
  tm_shape(median, name = "Probability model") + tm_raster(title = paste0("Model probability for ",species))+
    tm_shape(cleanPoints, name = "All Occurrences")+ 
    tm_dots(col = "type",palette=c(H="#1184D4", G='#6300F0'))+
  tm_shape(hP, name = "H Occurrences")+
    tm_dots(col = hPColor)+
  tm_shape(gP, name = "G Occurrences")+ 
    tm_dots(col = gPColor) 
  
  }else{
    if(nrow(hP)==0){
    tm_shape(median, name = "Probability model") + tm_raster(title = paste0("Model probability for ",species))+
    tm_shape(cleanPoints, name = "All Occurrences")+ 
    tm_dots(col = "type",palette=c(G='#6300F0'))+
  tm_shape(gP, name = "G Occurrences")+ 
    tm_dots(col = gPColor) 
    }else{
          hP <- cleanPoints[cleanPoints$type == "H",]
  tm_shape(median, name = "Probability model") + tm_raster(title = paste0("Model probability for ",species))+
    tm_shape(cleanPoints, name = "All Occurrences")+ 
    tm_dots(col = "type",palette=c(H="#1184D4", G='#6300F0'))+
  tm_shape(hP, name = "H Occurrences")+
    tm_dots(col = hPColor)
    }
  }
}
```

<br>

  
#### Standard deviation
The map below shows the standard deviation result across species distribution model replicates. Areas with a high standard deviation imply a limited agreement between the replicates. This is most likely to occur in areas with low sample (occurrence point) density.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(length(include(csv,"eval_metrics_rep.csv")) == 0){
  print("Models were produced for this taxon due to insufficent occurrences")
}else{
  tm_shape(sd, name = "Standard deviation")+
    tm_raster(title = paste0("Standard deviation of model for ",species))
}
```

<br>
  
  
#### Threshold (final species distribution model)
The map below shows the threshold (binary presence-absence) result from the species distribution modeling. This is the map used to perform the conservation gap analyses and to create the richness maps across taxa. The background shows the target native area (i.e. the occupied native country-ecoregion area). Predicted presence is displayed in green.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(length(include(csv,"eval_metrics_rep.csv")) == 0){
  print("Models were produced for this taxon due to insufficent occurrences")
}else{
  palette1 <- c("#FFFFFF","#45B320")
  tm_shape(thrshold, name = "Distribution model") + tm_raster(palette=palette1,style = "cat",
                                 title = paste0("Predicted presence of ", species))
}
```

<!-- #### Mess Map -->
<!-- The mess map identifies regions of the model that over project the top predictor. That is, areas of predicted presences that are above or below the observed range of the values assocaited with known occurrence data. There is less confidence that these areas are part of the distribution of the species because they are beyond the know conditions at what the species has been observed. -->
<!-- Areas with value 0 equal species potential range. -->
<!-- Areas with value 1 are regions that are potential over projected. -->
<!-- Areas with value 2 are predicted presences locations within the know environmental limit of the species.  -->

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# if(length(include(csv,"eval_metrics_rep.csv")) == 0){
#   print("Models were not produced for this taxon due to insufficent occurrences")
# }else{
#   mess[is.na(mess)] <- 0
#   mess1 <- mess + thrshold
#   palette1 <- c(  "#FFFFFF","#8c19b5", "#45B320")
#   tm_shape(mess1) + tm_raster(palette=palette1)+
#     tm_scale_bar() 
#   
#   
# }
```

<!-- #### Density of Sampling locations  -->
<!-- The map below show the relative concentration of occurence data across the predicted suitable habitat for the species.  -->

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# if(length(include(tif, "kernalDensity")) == 0){
#   print("No kernal density raster was generated for this species")
# }else{
#   th2 <- thrshold
#   th2[th2 == 0] <- NA
#   kd1 <- kDense * th2
#   tm_shape(kd1) + tm_raster()+
#     tm_scale_bar() 
# }
```
<br>
<br>
<br>


### Preliminary threat assessment
We calculated the extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO), adapted from the IUCN Red List criteria (AOO cell size 4 km2), using the occurrence data with coordinates in the native area of the taxon. Taxa are classified per metric and in combination, as Critically Endangered (CR) where EOO < 100 km2 or AOO < 10 km2, Endangered (EN) where 100 km2 < EOO < 5000 km2 or 10 km2 < AOO < 500 km2, Vulnerable (VU) where 5000 km2 < EOO < 20,000 km2 or 500 km2 < AOO < 2000 km2, Possible Near Threatened (NT) where 20,000 km2 > EOO < 45,000 km2 or 2000 km2 < AOO < 4500 km2, and Least Concern (LC) where EOO â‰¥ 45,000 km2 and AOO â‰¥ 4500 km2. Taxa with fewer than three distinct coordinates were automatically classified as CR. 
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(c1a2$`Total with coordinates`> 2){
  if(file.exists(paste0(baseDir,"/gap_analysis/redList/listingValues4kmClean.csv"))){
    rl <- read.csv(paste0(baseDir,"/gap_analysis/redList/listingValues4kmClean.csv")) 

rl <- rl[,c(2,3,4,5,7,8)]
colnames(rl) <- c("Taxon", "EOO area in km2", "EOO status", "AOO area in km2", "AOO status", "Combined status")
rl <- round_df(rl, digits = digits)
DT::datatable(rl)
}else{
  print("There are less then two records for this species and the EOO and AOO assessments were unable to be completed.")
}
}else{
    print("Unable to complete the redlist assessment on this speices")
  }
  

```

### Conservation gap analysis
<br>

#### Ex situ conservation

The table below shows the ex situ conservation gap analysis summary. The sampling representativeness score ex situ (SRSex) calculates the ratio of germplasm accessions (G) available in ex situ repositories to reference (H) records for each taxon, making use of all compiled records, regardless of whether they include coordinates. The geographical representativeness score ex situ (GRSex) uses buffers of 50 km radius created around each G collection coordinate point to estimate geographic areas already well collected within the distribution models of each taxon, and then calculates the proportion of the distribution model covered by these buffers. The ecological representativeness score ex situ (ERSex) calculates the proportion of terrestrial ecoregions represented within the G buffered areas out of the total number of ecoregions occupied by the distribution model. A final conservation score for ex situ (FCSex) was derived by calculating the average of the three ex situ conservation metrics. All of the conservation metrics are on a scale from 0-100, with 0 = poor conservation and 100 = comprehensive protection. The FCSex is used to categorize species, with urgent priority (UP) for further conservation action assigned when FCSex < 25, high priority (HP) where 25 â‰¤ FCSex < 50, medium priority (MP) where 50 â‰¤ FCSex < 75, and low priority (LP) for taxa whose FCSex â‰¥75.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#### Map of ex situ geographical representativeness (GRSex)
The map below shows the potential distribution (threshold map), with previous germplasm collection points surrounded by a 50 km buffer overlaid. Only germplasm (G) points are displayed on the map.

0 = Native area (area of ecoregions within countries where taxon has been observed in the field)

1 = Potential distribution

2 = G buffer (area where ex situ conservation is considered to have been accomplished)

#### In situ conservation


The table below shows the in situ conservation gap analysis summary.  The sampling representativeness score in situ (SRSin) calculates the proportion of all occurrences of a taxon within its predicted distribution that fall within a protected area. The geographical representativeness score in situ (GRSin) compares the area (in km2) of the distribution model located within protected areas versus the total area of the model. The ecological representativeness score in situ (ERSin) calculates the proportion of ecoregions encompassed within the range of the taxon located inside protected areas to the ecoregions encompassed within the total area of the distribution model. A final conservation score for in situ (FCSin) was derived by calculating the average of the three in situ conservation metrics.
All of the conservation metrics are on a scale from 0-100, with 0 = poor conservation and 100 = comprehensive protection. The FCSin is used to categorize species, with urgent priority (UP) for further conservation action assigned when FCSin < 25, high priority (HP) where 25 â‰¤ FCSin < 50, medium priority (MP) where 50 â‰¤ FCSin < 75, and low priority (LP) for taxa whose FCSin â‰¥75.

#### Combined conservation gap analysis 

The table below shows the combined ex situ and in situ conservation gap analysis metrics. Minimum and maximum scores are identified, and a combined final conservation score (FCSc-mean) was calculated by averaging the final ex situ (FCSex) and in situ (FCSin) scores. The taxon is then categorized, with urgent priority (UP) for further conservation action assigned when FCS < 25, high priority (HP) where 25 â‰¤ FCS < 50, medium priority (MP) where 50 â‰¤ FCS < 75, and low priority (LP) for taxa whose FCS â‰¥75.
